👋 Hi, I’m @PDHACK I'm new to git and also to all this universe of repositories and other things that happen here.
👀 I’m interested in in testing and learning in git about HTML and JS programming.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Dreamweaver, Atom and Git for desktop to program.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on with a streaming audio project.
